# terminal-clash

## Basic Details

### Team Name: Vannilla

### Team Members

### Project Description

terminal-clash is a CLI prank package that redefines what it means to “open your terminal.” Once installed, every command becomes a mockery of its former self. From ls to sudo, nothing works like you’d expect — and escaping is… discouraged.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People are too productive. Their terminals? Efficient. Their commands? Functional. Their power? Unchecked.
Where’s the chaos? Where’s the fun? Where’s the despair?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)Introduce Terminal Tyranny.

Hijack .bashrc or .zshrc with a full-blown rebellion of commands.
Add a fail-safe: typing terminal-clash sorry terminal Gods will restore order… maybe.
