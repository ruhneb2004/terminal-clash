# terminal-clash

## Basic Details

### Team Name: Vannilla

### Team Members

- Member 2: Krishna Sajeevan - GEC Thrissur

### Project Description

terminal-clash is a CLI prank package that redefines what it means to “open your terminal.” Once installed, every command becomes a mockery of its former self. From ls to sudo, nothing works like you’d expect — and escaping is… discouraged.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People are too productive. Their terminals? Efficient. Their commands? Functional. Their power? Unchecked.
Where’s the chaos? Where’s the fun? Where’s the despair?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)Introduce Terminal Tyranny.

Hijack .bashrc or .zshrc with a full-blown rebellion of commands.
Add a fail-safe: typing terminal-clash sorry terminal Gods will restore order… maybe.

terminal-clash hijacks your shell config (.zshrc or .bashrc) and overrides common commands with chaotic, mocking behavior. It backs up the original file so nothing’s permanent. To undo the madness, just run:
terminal-clash sorry terminal Gods and your terminal is restored.
